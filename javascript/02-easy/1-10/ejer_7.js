/*
?Which Function Returns the Larger Number?
Your function will be passed two functions, f and g, that don't take any parameters. 
Your function has to call them, and return a string which indicates which function returned the larger number.

If f returns the larger number, return the string f.
If g returns the larger number, return the string g.
If the functions return the same number, return the string neither.
Examples
whichIsLarger(() => 5, () => 10) ➞ "g"

whichIsLarger(() => 25,  () => 25) ➞ "neither"

whichIsLarger(() => 505050, () => 5050) ➞ "f"
Notes
This exercise is designed as an introduction to higher order functions (functions which use other functions to do their work).

const whichIsLarger = (f, g) => (f() > g() ? "f" : g() > f() ? "g" : "neither");

console.log(
  whichIsLarger(
    () => 5,
    () => 10
  )
);
console.log(
  whichIsLarger(
    () => 25,
    () => 25
  )

console.log(
  whichIsLarger(
    () => 505050,
    () => 5050
  )
