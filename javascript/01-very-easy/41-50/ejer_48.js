?I'd Like a New Shade of Blue, Please

I have a bucket containing an amount of navy blue paint and I'd like to paint as many walls as possible. Create a function that returns the number of complete walls that I can paint, before I need to head to the shops to buy more.

    n is the number of square meters I can paint.
    w and h are the widths and heights of a single wall in meters.

Examples

howManyWalls(100, 4, 5) ➞ 5

howManyWalls(10, 15, 12) ➞ 0

howManyWalls(41, 3, 6) ➞ 2

Notes

    Don't count a wall if I don't manage to finish painting all of it before I run out of paint.
    All walls will have the same dimensions.
    All numbers will be positive integers.
*/

const howManyWalls = (n, w, h) => {
  if (n < 0 || w < 0 || h < 0) {
    return "All numbers will be positive integers.";
  }

  return Math.floor(n / (w * h));
};

console.log(howManyWalls(100, 4, 5));
console.log(howManyWalls(10, 15, 12));
console.log(howManyWalls(41, 3, 6));
